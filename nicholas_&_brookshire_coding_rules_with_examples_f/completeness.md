## **Completeness** {#completeness}

### **_Missing essential information_** {#missing-essential-information}

*   **_~~If~~ _**only some**_ ~~of the essential information (bold~~ ~~italicized) for a main concept is mentioned, either in its list form or in a form that has the same general meaning, consider the main concept incomplete.~~_**
*   Broken Window Example - For main concept 2: **“_<sup>1</sup>A/The boy <sup>2</sup>was playing <sup>3</sup>soccer_”** the following statements would be incomplete:
    *   “The boy is playing.”
    *   “The boy soccer ball.”
*   Cinderella Example - For main concept 22: **“_<sup>1</sup>She <sup>2</sup>ran <sup>3</sup>down the stairs_”** the following statement would be incomplete:
    *   “And she had to run.”
        *   “she” is correct, if there is a clear pronoun referent or if it is not ambiguous; “run” is present; what is missing is “down the stairs” (or some acceptable alternative, e.g., out of the ball, away from the castle/prince/ball, out, away, etc.)

### **_Statements containing some of the essential information_** {#statements-containing-some-of-the-essential-information}

*   If a statement that is not listed as a main concept contains some of the essential information for a main concept, consider the main concept incomplete. 
*   Cookie Theft Example - For the main concept “The woman is doing the dishes” the following utterance would be considered incomplete:
    *   &quot;**The woman** is standing there&quot;. This would be the case as long as &quot;woman&quot; was not counted toward another main concept and the character has not been mentioned previously. Such statements serve to establish a character, element, or action in a story.
*   Broken Window Examples
    *   For main concept 4: **“_<sup>1</sup>The man <sup>2</sup>is sitting_** in a chair and/or inside the house.” the following statement would be incomplete:
        *   “The ball hit a man.”
    *   For main concept 2: **“_<sup>1</sup>A/The boy <sup>2</sup>was playing <sup>3</sup>soccer_”** the following statement would be incomplete:
        *   “It is a ball.”
*   Cinderella Examples
    *   For main concept 1 “**_<sup>1</sup>Dad <sup>2</sup>remarried <sup>3</sup>a woman_** with two daughters.”, the following statement would be considered incomplete/credited towards this main concept:
        *   “She lost her dad”, “Her dad died”, because this was the introduction/establishment of a major character of the story, and no other statements mapped on to this concept.
    *   For main concept 8 “King announces **_<sup>1</sup>there is going to be <sup>2</sup>a ball_** in honor of son who needs to find a wife.” or main concept 17 “**_<sup>1</sup>Cinderella <sup>2</sup>went <sup>3</sup>to the ball_ **in the coach”, the following statement could be credited towards one of those concepts, depending on where/when in the episodic structure the person produces the utterance:
        *   “Then …. ball”, because this introduces/establishes a major element of this story

### **_Nonspecific words_** {#nonspecific-words}

*   If nonspecific words are spoken in place of essential information, consider the main concept incomplete. 
*   Cookie Theft Example - For the main concept “The woman is washing the dishes”, the following statement would be incomplete:
    *   &quot;The woman is washing that thing.&quot;
        *   *BUT* In some cases there may be legitimate uncertainty about a specific person or element in a picture (e.g., &quot;Someone is fishing&quot; [WAB Picnic Scene]). In such instances, the nonspecific word will appear on the main concept list and its use will not render the main concept incomplete.
*   Broken Window Example - For main concept 4: **“_<sup>1</sup>The man <sup>2</sup>is sitting_** in a chair and/or inside the house”, the following statement would be incomplete:
    *   “Someone is in the house.”
*   Cat Rescue/Cat in the Tree Example - For main concept 8: “**_<sup>1</sup>Someone <sup>2</sup>called <sup>3</sup>the fire department_**.”
    *   This action is not pictured in the stimulus, so there is legitimate uncertainty about who calls. A reference to any person would be appropriate here, or the use of a nonspecific “somebody” or “someone”. (Examples are provided in the published checklist)

### **_Pronoun referents_** {#pronoun-referents}

*   **_~~If the referent for a pronoun is ambiguous, consider the main concept that contains the ambiguous pronoun incomplete, but only for the first use of the pronoun for that referent ~~_**
*   **_~~Do not consider a main concept incomplete if there is no antecedent referent for a pronoun but the referent is clear from context/unambi~~_**guous**_~~. ~~_**
    *   **_~~For example, if there is only one &quot;she&quot; or &quot;he&quot; or &quot;they&quot; in a picture, or only one figure is completing a specific action, the pronoun would be unambiguous without an antecedent referent. ~~_**
*   **_~~Cookie Theft Example – For~~ _**the main concept “The boy is falling off the stool” the following utterance is complete:
    *   **_~~“He is about to fall.”~~ _**This i**_~~s unambiguous without a referent because the only male figure in the picture is the little boy standing on the stool.~~_**
*   **_~~Broken Window Example~~_** - For main concept 4 “**_<sup>1</sup>The man <sup>2</sup>is sitting_** in a chair and/or inside the house” the following utterance is complete:
    *   **_~~“He is sitting inside.” This is unambiguous because there is only one person pictured inside the house.~~_**
*   Cinderella Examples
    *   Concept 2: **Cinderella lives with stepmother/stepsisters.**
        *   Does “they combined families” count?
            *   _If “they” is referring to some set of individuals that clearly includes Cinderella, then this could be interpreted similarly to “Cinderella/she has new family”, which would be allowed and would AC._
            *   _However, if “they” is unclear or if “they” is referring only to the father and the stepmother, this does not apply to this concept, it is a separate concept, and this would receive the code of AB._
        *   Does “When they brought Cinderella home…” count?
            *   _AC as long as appropriate pronoun referent; This seems to be most similar to a restructuring of acceptable alternatives of she/Cinderella (1), moves in with (2), new family/they (3)._
    *   Pronouns/antecedents: How stringent are the criteria for ensuring that the pronouns are unambiguous? If there is syntactic ambiguity regarding who went to the ball (e.g., in some cases “she went to the ball” could syntactically be either Cinderella or the Godmother), is that counted as incorrect even though it may be assumed shared knowledge that Cinderella went to the ball?
        *   _We allowed shared knowledge in those instances, so we would score that as AC, as long as both Cinderella and the Fairy Godmother had been mentioned (guided by Nicholas and Brookshire rules)_

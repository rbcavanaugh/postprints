# **Broken Window Main Concept Checklist** {#broken-window-main-concept-checklist}

Essential information is _italicized_ and **bolded**. Each essential segment is numbered (superscript) with alternative productions (if any were produced) listed by number below. These alternative productions ARE NOT intended to be an exhaustive list but represent some of the more common productions of the normative sample and are included to aid in scoring. Additional, but non-essential, information often spoken to complete the main concept is in normal font. If multiple utterances can correspond with an MC, select the best utterance presented for the purposes of coding/scoring.

1.  **_<sup><s>1</s></sup>~~A/The boy~~ <sup><s>2</s></sup>~~was~~ <sup><s>3</s></sup>~~outside.~~_**
    1.  **_~~He, any name (e.g., Johnny, Mark)~~_**
    2.  **_~~Is, decided to go~~_**
    3.  **_~~In his yard, on the lawn, out of the house, etc.~~_**

Note: Sometimes combined with MC2 in a statement such as “The boy was playing soccer outside” or “The boy was kicking the ball in the yard”. These statements would receive AC codes for MC1 and MC2.

1.  **_<sup><s>1</s></sup>~~A/The boy~~ <sup><s>2</s></sup>~~was playing~~ <sup><s>3</s></sup>~~soccer.~~_**
    1.  **_~~See 1.1 above~~_**
    2.  **_~~Plays, kicks, practices~~_**
    3.  **_~~With the soccer ball, with the ball, with the football* (*if dialectically appropriate)~~_**

Note: “He has a ball” or “He has a soccer ball” did not count towards this concept because it does not imply any kind of action with the soccer ball, and boy-action-ball was the concept that met criterion.

1.  **_<sup><s>1</s></sup>~~The ball~~ <sup><s>2</s></sup>~~breaks~~ <sup><s>3</s></sup>~~the man’s/neighbor’s window.~~_**
    1.  **_~~Soccer ball, football* (see 2.3)~~_**
    2.  **_~~Goes through, crashes through/into, flies through, sails through/into, shatters, is kicked through~~_**
    3.  **_~~glass~~_**
2.  **_<sup><s>1</s></sup>~~The man~~ <sup><s>2</s></sup>~~is sitting in a chair and/or inside the house.~~_**
    1.  **_~~The dad, the father, the neighbor, the guy, any name~~_**
    2.  **_~~Lounging, resting, relaxing, inside~~_**

Note: Most common were “The man is sitting,” “The man is inside,” and “The man is sitting inside.”

Note: “The man is watching TV” or something similar did not count for this concept; that was a separate relevant concept that did not meet the criterion.

1.  **_<sup><s>1</s></sup>~~The man~~ <sup><s>2</s></sup>~~was startled.~~_**
    1.  **_~~See 4.1~~_**
    2.  **_~~Surprised, amazed, afraid, astonished, freaked out, stunned, shocked, angry, upset, not happy, mad~~_**

Note: Occasionally, this concept was combined with MC3 in a statement such as, “The ball crashed through the window and startled the man” or with MC4 in a statement such as “The man sitting there was startled” or “The startled man was sitting in the living room”.

1.  **_<sup><s>1</s></sup>~~The ball~~ <sup><s>2</s></sup>~~breaks~~ <sup><s>3</s></sup>~~a lamp.~~_**
    1.  **_~~See 3.1~~_**
    2.  **_~~Knocks down, knocks over, smashes into, hits~~_**
2.  **_<sup><s>1</s></sup>~~The man~~ <sup><s>2</s></sup>~~picks up~~ <sup><s>3</s></sup>~~the ball.~~_**
    1.  **_~~See 4.1~~_**
    2.  **_~~Grabs, gets, holds, catches, captures, has~~_**
    3.  **_~~See 3.1~~_**

Note: Occasionally, “The man stands up with the ball” or “The man jumps up with the ball” were used to express this concept.

1.  **_<sup><s>1</s></sup>~~The man~~ <sup><s>2</s></sup>~~looked~~ <sup><s>3</s></sup>~~out of the window.~~_**
    1.  **_~~See 4.1~~_**
    2.  **_~~Looks~~_**
    3.  **_~~Outside, out, out of the glass~~_**

Note: “The man goes to the window,” or “The man goes outside” do not count towards this concept. These were separate relevant concepts that did not meet criterion.

## **Accuracy** {#accuracy}

### **_Wording_** {#wording}

*   **_~~The wording of essential information does not have to be the same as that of the listed main concept, but the general meaning must be the same. ~~_**
    *   **_~~Some alternate versions of essential information in specific main concepts are given in parentheses in the main concept lists. There may be appropriate alternatives not listed. ~~_**
    *   **_~~Figures of speech and colloquialisms are acceptable.~~_**
*   **_~~Cookie Theft Example - For the main concept, &quot;The woman is doing the dishes,&quot; the following statements would be considered accurate because they are plausible given the stimulus picture:~~_**
    *   **_~~The mother is cleaning the dishes.~~_**
    *   **_~~The maid is drying a plate.~~_**
    *   **_~~The lady was washing her dishes.~~_**
*   **_~~Broken Window Example – For main concept 4~~_** “**_<sup>1</sup>The man <sup>2</sup>is sitting_** in a chair and/or inside the house”, **_~~the following statements would be considered accurate.~~_**
    *   **_~~The father is relaxing in his recliner.~~_**
    *   **_~~The neighbor is sitting in the living room.~~_**
    *   **_~~The man is resting and watching TV.~~_**
    *   The man is sitting.
    *   He is just sitting there. (as long as “he” is not ambiguous, e.g., pointing to third frame, or following a sentence like “That must be the neighbor. He is just sitting there.”, etc.)
*   Cinderella Examples
    *   Concept 1: **Dad remarried a woman** with two daughters.
        *   Is married OK, or does it have to say ‘remarried’?
            *   _Married is ok. There does not have to be some indication of repetition – the first choice in the appendix is “got married to” which does not require some indication of repetition_
    *   Concept 3: **_<sup>1</sup>Stepmother/ stepsisters <sup>2</sup>were mean <sup>3</sup>to Cinderella._**
        *   Does “they treated her like dirt” count?
            *   _If “her” clearly references Cinderella based on transcript, and “they” clearly reference the stepmother and/or stepsisters, “like dirt” matches the alternative productions in terms of semantic meaning, so this would be accurate (and complete)_
        *   Does “her mother was kind of mean to her” count?
            *   _If they do not mention the word “step”, there must be/have been some indication that the stepmother is a unit separate from Cinderella; mother here implies “real” or “biological” mother, which would be inaccurate_
            *   _It could also be argued that “kind of mean” is not the same as the options indicated in the checklist - “mean, cruel, wicked, treated Cinderella poorly, were awful, hated” - but this may be too subjective_
    *   Concept 5: Cinderella **has to do** all the housework
        *   “Had some chores that she should do”
            *   _Because verb &quot;should&quot; is a suggestion, and not a verb portraying that does not leave a choice/force/control, it changes the meaning. THIS IS HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE AND A RULE WITH FREQUENT DISAGREEMENT_
    *   Concept 8\. **They got an invitation** to the ball.
        *   “there was an announcement about a ball” (assuming not OK, as there was no alternative for ‘invitation’)
            *   _You are correct, invitation was the only word used for this concept. “announcement about a ball” could be applied to MC7 though (King announces_ **_there is going to be a ball_** _in honor of son who needs to find a wife.)_
    *   Concept 11: **The stepsisters tore Cinderella’s dress.**
        *   Does it have to be the dress or can “tore jewelry” count?
            *   _We have accepted jewelry in the past though no other alternatives are listed in the appendix, it is something that is torn and is visible in the picture book as well, and we didn’t explicitly say “no alternatives were produced”, as we did for invitation._
    *   Concept 21: Cinderella realized **it is midnight.**
        *   Does “at midnight she had to run away” count?
            *   _Yes, this would count_
    *   Concept 22: **She ran down the stairs.**
        *   “she ran off” – does this count? Or does it have to be “ran away” or “ran out”?
            *   _“off” would count_

### **_Grammatical form and word order_** {#grammatical-form-and-word-order}

*   Essential information does not have to be spoken in standard grammatical form or standard word order, as long as deviations would not lead to miscomprehension of the essential meaning of the main concept. 
*   Cookie Theft Example - For the main concept, &quot;The woman is doing the dishes,&quot; the following statements would be considered accurate:
    *   Mother do dishes.
    *   Lady drying some plate.
    *   Woman dishes drying them.
*   **_~~Broken Window Example – For main concept~~_** 6 **_~~“~~<sup>1</sup>The ball <sup>2</sup>breaks <sup>3</sup>a lamp.~~” the following statements would be considered accurate.~~_**
    *   **_~~Ball break lamp(s).~~_**
    *   **_~~Ball lamp broken.~~_**
    *   Lamp is broken um ball boom.

### **_Articulation_** {#articulation}

*   Essential words do not have to be correctly articulated to be considered accurate, as long as they would be intelligible to a listener as the target words in the context of what the speaker is saying. 
    *   Assume that the listener has seen the stimulus picture.
*   Broken Window Example
    *   Concept 6: “**_<sup>1</sup>The ball <sup>2</sup>breaks <sup>3</sup>a lamp._**”
        *   “knocked over a **lap** in the man’s house after going through the window”
    *   Concept 3: **_<sup>1</sup>The ball <sup>2</sup>breaks <sup>3</sup>the_** man’s/neighbor’s **_window._**
        *   “And window ch **bwoke** by ball”
    *   Concept 2: **_<sup>1</sup>A/The boy <sup>2</sup>was playing <sup>3</sup>soccer._**
        *   “Dah boy **bahlayed** soccer”

### **_Inaccurate [nonessential] words in accurate main concepts_** {#inaccurate-nonessential-words-in-accurate-main-concepts}

*   **_~~If the essential information in a main concept is accurate, but inaccurate words also are included in the concept, consider the main concept accurate unless the inaccurate words alter essential information to make it inaccurate. ~~_**
*   **_~~Cookie Theft Example - For the main concept~~ _**“The woman/mother is doing dishes”, the following statement would be considered accurate:
    *   **_~~&quot;The woman is drying the dishes with a bath towel&quot;~~_**
        *   E**_~~ven though the woman is using a dish towel, the essential information is accurate,~~ _**because “towel” or “cloth” is not an essential element**_~~.~~_**
*   **_~~Broken Window Example - For main concept 4~~ _**“**_<sup>1</sup>The man <sup>2</sup>is sitting_** in a chair and/or inside the house”, the following statement would be considered accurate:
    *   **_~~&quot;The man is sitting reading a newspaper&quot;~~_**
        *   E**_~~ven though the man is not reading anything, the essential information is accurate, and~~ _**“reading a newspaper” is not essential**_~~.~~_**
    *   “The man sit sofa”
        *   Even though he is sitting in a chair, not on a sofa, the essential information is accurate, and “chair” is not essential
        *   (See also above rule for Accuracy/Grammatical form and word order for “The man sit” portion of this production)
*   Cinderella Examples - For main concept 19: “**_<sup>1</sup>The prince and Cinderella <sup>2</sup>danced_** around the room/all night/with no one else”, the following statement would be considered inaccurate:
    *   &quot;Um… man i-is dancing da teacher and Cinderella um dances on&quot;
        *   teacher replaces man, which makes it incorrect because it&#039;s not the prince, but Cinderella and the verb dancing are present, completing all the elements.

### **_Effects of statement form on essential information_** {#effects-of-statement-form-on-essential-information}

*   The form in which a speaker chooses to state a main concept affects which information is considered essential. 
*   Cookie Theft Example - Not provided by Nicholas &amp; Brookshire (1995). (The example they give in their appendix is for the procedure of how to do dishes.)
*   Broken Window Example - We haven’t actually seen an example of this.
*   Refused Umbrella Example - for main concept 2 “The mother says **_<sup>1</sup>you <sup>2</sup>need to take <sup>3</sup>the umbrella_**”, the following would be considered accurate (see checklist, Note 1):
    *   “**_<sup>2</sup>_**Take this **_<sup>3</sup>_**umbrella”, since English allows the subject to be dropped in a command.

### **_Inaccurate pronoun referents_** {#inaccurate-pronoun-referents}

*   If a referent is inaccurate but a pronoun that refers to it is accurate, consider the statement with the pronoun accurate. 
*   Cookie Theft Example - For the main concept “The woman is doing dishes” if the following statements were made:
    *   &quot;The man is washing dishes. She is not paying attention to her kids&quot;
        *   The first statement would be considered inaccurate but the second would be considered accurate.
*   Broken Window Example - For main concept 7 “**_<sup>1</sup>The man <sup>2</sup>picks up <sup>3</sup>the ball_**” if the following statements were made:
    *   &quot;The woman picks up the ball. He looks out the window.&quot;
        *   The first statement would be considered inaccurate but the second statement would be considered accurate because the pronoun correctly refers to a male.

### **_Restatement of essential information_** {#restatement-of-essential-information}

*   If essential information is stated one way and then restated, score the final version spoken. 
*   Cookie Theft Example - for the main concept “The woman is doing the dishes” if the following statements were made:
    *   &quot;The woman, he is doing the dishes.&quot; This statement would be considered inaccurate.
    *   &quot;The man no woman is doing the dishes,&quot; the statement would be considered accurate.
*   Broken Window Example - for main concept 2 “**_<sup>1</sup>A/The boy <sup>2</sup>was playing <sup>3</sup>soccer._**” if the following statements were made:
    *   “The boy is playing baseball, no, soccer,” the statement would be considered accurate.
    *   “The boy was kicking a soccer ball. And the ball goes way up high. So the boy was playing baseball.”
        *   You would score “The boy was playing baseball” for main concept 2, because this is a restatement of the first utterance, even though it results in a lower score.
*   Refused Umbrella Example - individuals with more cognitive involvement may not realize/express their understanding at first that the mother has offered the umbrella (main concept 2) and that the boy has refused it (main concept 3), but may correct themselves when they get to the bottom panel (pictures 4-6). They may then go back and revise their statements and these revisions (the final versions) would be what is scored.
    *   (This may mean that they end up scoring quite well for main concepts, but you should make a notation somewhere that this individual “missed” the gist, which was NOT commonly observed in controls OR PWAs, and may warrant further assessment of cognitive abilities/inference.)

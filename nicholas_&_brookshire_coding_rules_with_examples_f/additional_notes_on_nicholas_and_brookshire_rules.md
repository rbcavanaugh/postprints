## Additional Notes on Nicholas and Brookshire Rules {#additional-notes-on-nicholas-and-brookshire-rules}

*   **_~~Main concepts do not have to be spoken in the same order they are shown in the main concept list.~~_**
    *   **_~~Broken Window Example~~_**
        *   **_~~“~~_~~There is a little boy playing soccer, he’s outside in the yard~~_~~”~~_**
            *   **_~~MC2 is produced first and should be coded as AC. MC1 is produced second and should also be coded as AC.~~_**
*   **_~~If a main concept is spoken several times, ALWAYS score the final version.~~_**
    *   **_~~Broken Window Example~~_**
        *   **_~~“The boy is playing soccer, practicing for the team try-outs, so he’s kicking the ball, and it goes right through the window”~~_**
            *   **_~~Both “the boy is playing soccer” and “he’s kicking the ball” apply to MC2\. Since, “he’s kicking the ball” is produced later, that is the utterance that should be scored for MC2.~~_**
            *   **_~~This is true even if the later utterance results in an error code, while the first utterance would receive an AC code.~~_**
*   **_~~Essential elements for main concepts can be produced across multiple utterances.~~_**
    *   There are many different criteria used to segment discourse into utterances. Practicing clinicians may not have the time or training on specific segmenting approaches. If essential elements are produced within a reasonable distance within a string of words, regardless of where utterance boundaries may be placed, they can still count towards a single main concept.
    *   Broken Window Example - for main concept 8: “**_<sup>1</sup>The man <sup>2</sup>looked <sup>3</sup>out of the window._**” the following utterances can be scored together:
        *   *   Utterance 1: “_man gets up.”_
            *   Utterance 2: “_mad mad mad.”_
            *   Utterance 3: “_looks out the window._
*   **_~~The verb tense used in the production should not impact the code received. Any inflected form of the verbs listed in the checklist should be allowed.~~_**
    *   **_~~Broken Window Example~~_** - for main concept **_~~8:~~ _**“**_<sup>1</sup>The man <sup>2</sup>looked <sup>3</sup>out of the window._**” the following utterances would be accurate and complete:
        *   *   **~~“the man is looking outside”~~**
            *   **~~“so the man will go look out the glass to see who’s there”~~**
            *   **~~“the man looks out the window”~~**
*   One utterance can be used to produce two or more main concepts
    *   Broken Window Example - for main concept 7 “**_<sup>1</sup>The man <sup>2</sup>picks up <sup>3</sup>the ball._**” and 8 “**_<sup>1</sup>The man <sup>2</sup>looked <sup>3</sup>out of the window._**” the following statement would be accurate and complete:
        *   *   “the man picks up the ball and looks out.”
            *   “the man looks out the window holding the ball.”

OTHER EXAMPLES, TO BE FILED UNDER CORRECT ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS RULE

*   Cinderella Examples
    *   Concept 1: **Dad remarried a woman** with two daughters.
        *   OK if this spans 2 utterances? (e.g., The dad remarried. The woman was mean…)
            *   _We would score “the dad remarried” as AI – The object of the sentence is missing. “The woman was mean” was actually a separate concept that is seen represented in the 3<sup>rd</sup> concept in the appendix._
            *   _We have had disagreement over this, as we have stated that MCs can span utterances, and since there is a clear inference/relationship in this example._
    *   Concept 18: She knew **she had to be home by midnight** because everything will turn back at midnight.
        *   _Does “Had to be back by midnight” count?_
            *   _would code as AC, assuming there was a subject; if no subject, then AI_
    *   Concept 10: **Cinderella** is told by the stepmother she **cannot go** to the ball unless/because (insert reason)
        *   Would “And Cinderella um go no” count as complete for this?
            *   _Scored as AI, however, it matters if the patient intends “no” as a revision_
    *   _There are examples in Richardson &amp; Dalton (2016) of how to code utterances where verbs are omitted (i.e., “Mother dishes” is AI), but none where a subject is omitted. Is it necessary for an utterance to have a subject to be an MC? Or could an utterance be coded as AI/II if it is missing the subject but contains other essential components?_
        *   _A STATEMENT DOES NOT HAVE TO HAVE A SUBJECT TO BE CODED AS AN MC, IT CAN BE GIVEN AN AI/II CODE AS APPROPRIATE._
    *   _How does more complex syntax influence the interpretation of MCs? Specifically, what do you do if the participant uses a compound predicate; can this count as 2 MCs with the common subject (e.g., “Cinderella lives with her stepmother and stepsisters and had to do all the housework for them.”)_
        *   _WE WOULD GIVE CREDIT FOR BOTH MCs. BOTH WOULD RECEIVE AN &quot;AC&quot;._
    *   _What if the MC subject is an object of a sentence with a verb clause following it that includes the MC verb/object (e.g., “there was a girl named Cinderella who lived with her stepmother and stepsisters.”)_
        *   _IN THE SECOND INSTANCE, WE WOULD GIVE CREDIT FOR MC2 FOR THE VERB CLAUSE. &quot;WHO&quot; CLEARLY REFERENCES CINDERELLA IN THE MAIN CLAUSE, SO THE PARTICIPANT SUCCESSFULLY PRODUCED THE SUBJECT (WHO = CINDERELLA), VERB (LIVED), AND ADDITIONAL INFO (WITH STEPMOM/STEPSISTERS). WE WOULD CODE THIS AS AN &quot;AC&quot; FOR MC2._
    *   _How much of an utterance is needed to count as a main concept? “At the strike of midnight” has no subject and no verb, but includes “strike” (as a noun) and “midnight” – two of the essential elements from MC 21\. Does this still count as MC 21?_
        *   _WE WOULD COUNT THIS AS MC 21\. THIS GOES BACK TO THE NICHOLAS &amp; BROOKSHIRE RULE THAT SAYS THAT THE FORMULATION OF THE MC CAN IMPACT WHAT IS CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL. SINCE THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE FORMULATION IN ENGLISH TO EXPRESS THE CONCEPT OF IT BEING MIDNIGHT, IT WOULD BE SCORED AS &quot;AC&quot;._
    *   _How do you count subordinate clauses that do have a separate verb from the main clause? Can the subordinate clause stand on its own as an MC? (e.g., “Cinderella lives with her stepmother and stepsisters who are very mean to her”)_
        *   _YES, WE WOULD ALLOW THIS STATEMENT TO RECEIVE CREDIT FOR BOTH MC2 AND MC3._
    *   _How do you handle situations in which an utterance clearly relates to an MC, but is formulated with different words? Do you handle it differently if the utterance requires an inference to understand how it is related? (e.g., “her dad introduces Cinderella to his new wife” – implies he got re-married [MC1]; “the king is upset that his son hasn’t married” – implies the king thinks his son should get married [MC6]; “one of the caveats of the fairy’s spell is that it ended at midnight” – implies [MC18])_
        *   _THESE EXAMPLES SHOULD NOT COUNT TOWARDS THE MCs YOU IDENTIFIED, AS IT REQUIRES TOO MUCH INFERENCE AND DOES NOT DIRECTLY EXPRESS THE GIST; ALSO, IN OUR NORMING SAMPLE, EACH OF THOSE STATEMENTS WERE RELEVANT CONCEPTS THAT DID NOT REACH THE CUT-OFF TO BE CONSIDERED MCs._
        *   _BUT SEE RULE FOR COMPLETENESS/_**_Statements containing some of the essential information_**

TO BE ANSWERED

*   *   Concept 3: Stepmother and/or stepsisters were mean to Cinderella
        *   “They didn’t really give her enough attention”
        *   What is the strength of &quot;giving enough attention&quot; and how does it relate to main concept of &quot;being mean&quot; ?
    *   Concept 4: Cinderella was a servant to the stepmother and stepsisters.
        *   “She was white trash”
        *   Is white trash similar enough to being lesser than, but not similar enough to servitude? OR is it just a statement that is being made by the participant and it doesn&#039;t really add/contribute to the main concept?

# **Cat Rescue Main Concepts** {#cat-rescue-main-concepts}

Essential information is **_italicized and bolded_**. Each essential segment is numbered (superscript) with alternative productions (if any were produced) listed by number below. These alternative productions are not intended to be an exhaustive list but represent some of the more common productions of the normative sample and are included to aid in scoring. Additional, but non-essential, information often spoken to complete the main concept is in normal font.

“Now I’m going to show you these pictures.&quot; (Present picture series.)

“Here are some more pictures that tell a story. Take a look at all of them, and then I’ll ask you to tell me the story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. Again, you can look at the pictures as you tell the story.”

If no response in 10 seconds, give second prompt: “Look at this picture (point to first picture) and tell me what you think is happening.”

If needed, point to each picture sequentially, giving the prompt: “And what happens here?”

For each panel, if no response, provide the prompt: “Can you tell me anything about this picture?”

If no response, go to Troubleshooting questions.

Present picture book (or ppt/pdf).

“I’m going to ask you to tell a story. Have you ever heard the story of Cinderella?

(Make note of answer for demographic data. If answer is no, ask participant to tell a fairy tale s/he knows.)

Do you remember much about it? These pictures might remind you of how it goes. Take a look at the pictures and then I’ll put the book away, and ask you to tell me the story in your own words.”

Allow participant to look through book (assist with page turning if needed) and then, if necessary, prompt: “Now tell me as much of the story of Cinderella as you can. You can use any details you know about the story, as well as the pictures you just looked at.”

If participant gives a response of fewer than three utterances, or seems to falter, allow 10 seconds, then prompt: “What happened next?” or “Go on.”

Continue until participant concludes story or it is clear s/he has finished.

If no response, go to Troubleshooting questions.

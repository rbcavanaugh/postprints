# **Introduction** {#introduction}

**_~~Main Concept Analysis (MCA) is a discourse assessment originally developed by Nicholas and Brookshire (1995) that measures the informativeness of a discourse sample~~ _**on**_ ~~a given topic. Main concept checklists for several widely used tasks (including picture description, picture sequence, story retell, and procedural stimuli) have been developed based on discourse samples of control speakers (Richardson &amp; Dalton, 2016; 2020). MCA is a hybrid discourse measure that provides some information on micro-linguistic features of the discourse sample as well as more macro-linguistic features about the overall adequacy of the discourse sample to communicate an intended message.~~_**

**_~~MCA has shown good sensitivity in differentiating between controls and individuals with communication disorders (e.g., Kong, Whiteside, &amp; Bargmann, 2016; Dalton &amp; Richardson, 2019)~~_** and**_ ~~between individuals with fluent and non-fluent aphasia (Kong et al., 2016). Importantly, studies have shown that changes in informativeness are associated with treatment performance (Albright &amp; Purves, 2008; Avent &amp; Austermann, 2003; Coelho, McHugh, &amp; Boyle, 2000; Cupit, Rochon, Leonard, &amp; Laird, 2010; Stark, 2010) and are associated with listener’s perceptions of communication quality (Cupit et al., 2010; Ross &amp; Wertz, 1999).~~_**

**_~~Each main concept consists of several essential elements, corresponding to the subject, main verb, object (if appropriate), and any subordinate clauses (Nicholas &amp; Brookshire, 1995). The main concept is assigned one of 5 codes depending on the accuracy (are the essential elements accurate?) and completeness (are essential elements present?) of the production~~_**.

Coding:

*   **_~~AC = accurate and complete = contains all elements of the main concept on the checklist with no incorrect information ~~_**
*   **_~~AI = accurate and incomplete = contains no incorrect information, but leaves out at least one essential element of the main concept on the checklist ~~_**
*   **_~~IC = inaccurate and complete = contains at least one incorrect piece of essential information (e.g., “knight” for “prince”) but includes all essential elements of the main concept on the checklist ~~_**
*   **_~~II = inaccurate and incomplete = clearly corresponds with a main concept on the checklist but includes at least one incorrect essential element and fails to include at least one essential element ~~_**
*   **_~~AB = absent~~ _**= **_~~did not produce the main concept~~_**

Scoring*:

Richardson and Dalton, 2016 Kong, 2009

_Accurate &amp; Complete (AC):_ 3 Points _Accurate &amp; Complete (AC):_ 3 Points

_Accurate &amp; Incomplete (AI):_ 2 Points _Accurate &amp; Incomplete (AI):_ 2 Point

_Inaccurate &amp; Complete (IC):_ 2 Points _Inaccurate (I, IC and II):_ 1 Point

_Inaccurate &amp; Incomplete (II):_ 1 Point _Absent (AB):_ 0 Points

_Absent (AB):_ 0 Points

_*To our knowledge, norms for AphasiaBank stimuli are only available for the Richardson &amp; Dalton 2016 scoring system. If using the Kong, 2009 system, scores cannot be compared to the Richardson &amp; Dalton 2016 norms. See Kong et al., 2016 for main concepts, checklists, and norms for additional stimuli._

**_~~Nicholas and Brookshire also developed a series of coding rules to assist in determining the accuracy and completeness of main concepts. These coding rules are now supplemented with the published checklists, which provide common alternatives produced for each main concept, since there is variability in the syntax and vocabulary that could be used to produce a main concept. These alternative lists are not comprehensive, so it is possible that a client may produce an acceptable alternative that is not in the checklist.~~_**

Note to Remember:

*   Main concepts do not have to be given in the transcript in the same order they are shown in the main concept list.
    *   Cinderella Example
        *   Concept: 18\. She knew **she had to be home by midnight** because everything will turn back at midnight.
            *   What if this occurs later in the story (e.g., after #21 – something like “she heard the clock and knew she had to be home by midnight”)
                *   _Yes, we would still allow that to count. There seemed to be a couple of “typical” orderings of MCs. We went with the most frequent when ordering our list._
                *   _More/updated information on sequencing for Cinderella is available via Greenslade et al., 2020 -_ [_https://doi.org/10.1044/2020_AJSLP-19-00151_](https://doi.org/10.1044/2020_AJSLP-19-00151)
*   If a main concept is spoken several times, score the final version.
*   Essential elements can be produced across multiple utterances.

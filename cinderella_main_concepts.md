# **Cinderella Main Concepts** {#cinderella-main-concepts}

Essential information is **_italicized and bolded_**. Each essential segment is numbered (superscript), with alternative productions (if any were produced) listed by number below. These alternative productions are not intended to be an exhaustive list, but represent some of the more common productions of the normative sample and are included to aid in scoring. Additional, but non-essential, information often spoken to complete the main concept is in normal font.

1) **_<sup>1</sup>Dad <sup>2</sup>remarried <sup>3</sup>a woman_** with two daughters. †

1\. _Daddy/Father_

1\. _She*_

2_. Is left with, moves in with, grows up with, has_

i._If they do not mention the word “step”, there must be a clear indication that the_

_stepmother and stepsisters (the lady and her two daughters, the mean woman and her beautiful daughters) are a unit separate from Cinderella._

Note 1: After Cinderella has been introduced into the story “she” is an acceptable alternative as long as there is a clear pronoun referent.

Note 2: After the stepmother and stepsisters have been introduced into the story “they” is an acceptable alternative as long as there is a clear pronoun referent.

2_. Was forced to be, had to be_

3_. Maid, slave, domestic_
